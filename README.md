This TouchDesigner project provides a real-time previsualization system for UCLA's EDA Immersive Projection System.

In order to run this project, you'll need to [download TouchDesigner](https://www.derivative.ca/099/Downloads/experimental.asp) and have at least a non-commercial license. This project was created in Version 2019.13330.

To load files, move your mouse towards the bottom of the window and use the Load File buttons. Please note that all files should have the same number of frames. The middle channel is what drives playback for all three.
